# Development Task Queue

> **Overview:** Sprint-level task queue with complexity tagging. Agents execute tasks top to bottom within the current sprint. Each task is sized so it can be completed in a single session.

## Complexity Tags

Tags help agents self-select whether a task needs the full `execute-feature.md` pipeline or a lighter `dev-cycle.md`:

| Tag     | Meaning                                  | Recommended Command                         |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `[XS]`  | Trivial — single file, known pattern     | dev-cycle.md                                |
| `[S]`   | Small — 1-3 files, well-understood       | dev-cycle.md                                |
| `[M]`   | Medium — 3-8 files, some planning needed | dev-cycle.md with plan-feature pre-read     |
| `[L]`   | Large — feature spanning modules         | execute-feature.md                          |
| `[XL]`  | Very large — architecture-affecting      | execute-feature.md, requires architect role |
| `[BUG]` | Bug fix                                  | fix-build.md                                |

```

**Removed:** `apps/worker` (queue logic absorbed into API via BullMQ), `packages/adapters` (whatsapp-web.js → Meta Cloud API), `packages/memory` (replaced by InMemoryProvider in core).

## Notes

- All old v1 build phases are **superseded** by the wa-manager rebase
- The Meta WhatsApp Cloud API replaces whatsapp-web.js as the message transport (official API, no Puppeteer dependency)
- The Next.js dashboard from wa-manager replaces the old React/Vite dashboard
- Engineering principles (§1-10) apply to every phase — reviewer role checks compliance before sign-off
- Original wa-manager: https://github.com/godopetza/wa-manager
