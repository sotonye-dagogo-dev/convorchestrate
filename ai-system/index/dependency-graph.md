## Module Dependency Map

```
apps/api
  -> @convorchestrate/core
  -> @convorchestrate/meta-api
  -> @convorchestrate/schemas
  -> @convorchestrate/utils
  -> nestjs-pino, bullmq, ioredis, typeorm
  -> @nestjs/*, @fastify/*, passport, jwt, bcrypt

apps/dashboard
  -> next, react, react-dom
  -> @radix-ui/*, recharts, @monaco-editor/react, lucide-react

packages/core
  -> @convorchestrate/schemas (types + validators)
  -> (self-contained: InMemoryProvider replaces @convorchestrate/memory)

packages/meta-api
  -> (no @convorchestrate/* internal deps — fetch-based, zero runtime deps)

packages/schemas
  -> ajv, ajv-formats, zod

packages/utils
  -> (no internal dependencies)
```

**Removed:** `apps/worker`, `packages/adapters` (whatsapp-web.js), `packages/memory` (Redis) — all superseded by wa-manager rebase

## Dependency Rules

- packages/core must not import packages/adapters (removed — now uses InMemoryProvider directly)
- apps should import shared packages, not the other way around
- packages/utils must not depend on app code
- Controllers may depend on Services — not the other way around
- packages/meta-api must have zero internal @convorchestrate/* dependencies (pure fetch-based Meta API wrapper)
